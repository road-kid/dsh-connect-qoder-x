/**
 * The plugin's data directory — the ONE place every file the plugin owns
 * lives.
 *
 * Layout: `<profile>/.dsh-connect-qoder-x/state/` (the profile discovered
 * the same way the credential store always did). Everything — PAT files,
 * saved catalogs, probe records, the host heartbeat, and the machine-id
 * seed — writes there, so a profile directory never collects loose
 * `.qoder-*` files and the whole plugin's footprint is one folder.
 *
 * Fallbacks, in order: `DSH_QODER_DATA_DIR` env override → the discovered
 * profile → the Harness home (a checkout running its own tests, or a host
 * loading the plugin from outside any profile).
 *
 * Split out of `auth.ts` so catalog/probe/heartbeat stores can import the
 * directory without pulling in the credential code (and its upstream
 * dependency) — these modules stay leaf-light on purpose.
