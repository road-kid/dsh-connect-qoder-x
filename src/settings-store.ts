/**
 * Plugin-owned settings store — the single source of truth for this plugin's
 * user configuration on every host line.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * A settings write on DSH 0.1.7 goes through the profile patch
 * (`configEditor.edit`), which reconciles the whole loader tree and hot-reloads
 * the plugin's fiber (~1–1.5 s, plus a storm of client mirror refreshes) on
 * EVERY write — one per toggled switch. The plugin's own files (the credential,
 * the catalog cache) have always lived in `<profile>/.dsh-connect-qoder-x/`, so
 * the settings move there too: a write becomes a small atomic local file write
 * with an in-memory apply, no tree reconcile, no reload.
 *
 * FILE
 *   <plugin data dir>/settings.json   (same directory as the credential)
 *
 * The data directory is resolved by `qoderPluginDataDir()` — the ONE discovery
 * implementation this plugin already has (env override, then the declaring
 * profile, then the installing link). It is deliberately not re-implemented
 * here: a second copy of that logic is how a nested `.dsh-connect-qoder-x/
 * .dsh-connect-qoder-x/` path gets shipped.
 *
 * MIGRATION (one time)
 *   the file is absent → seed it from the entry config's own fields → write the
 *   file → delete ONLY this plugin's fields from the entry config (see
 *   ./index.ts), so the profile row returns to its shipped state.
 *
 * @module dsh-connect-qoder-x/settings-store
