 *    that the upstream *validates* the parameter, the verified spellings are

 *
 * A `non-validating` observation deliberately yields no control: an upstream
 * that accepts values that cannot exist would make every per-level acceptance
 * a false positive.
 *
 * `off` is offered only when the upstream declares `canDisableThinking: true`.
 * It is never probed — disabling thinking is a separate capability, and the
 * per-model acceptance of `off` cannot be inferred from the row's shape.
