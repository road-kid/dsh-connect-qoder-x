 * `supportedEfforts` set, and it always loses to a declared set. The plan this
 * implements (`docs/reasoning-effort-probe-plan.md` §5) requires that a result
 * is invalidated whenever the model's catalog row changes, so every record
 * carries a fingerprint of the fields the probe depended on.
 *
 * The file lives in the plugin's own state directory, never beside the
 * product's files, and carries no token, prompt, or response body — only
 * model ids, effort spellings, and timestamps.
