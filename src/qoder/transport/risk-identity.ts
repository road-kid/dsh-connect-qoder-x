/**
 * Device risk identity for the Qoder campaign endpoints.
 *
 * Qoder's international service only hands out the daily claim campaign to
 * requests that carry a machine identity minted by its OWN desktop client.
 * Measured against the live upstream: the same account, token and headers get
 * an empty/lifeless `campaigns` array without it, and the real
 * `CLAIM_BENEFIT` campaign with it — so a check-in built on a self-made
 * machine id reports "no campaign today" forever while looking healthy at the
 * transport layer (HTTP 200, no error).
 *
 * The identity cannot be synthesized: it is produced by the client's signed
 * `runtime-info` helper, which fingerprints the real machine (its hardware,
 * its VM status) and signs the answer. The only honest way to obtain one is
 * to ask an installed Qoder client to produce it, which is what this module
 * does. When no client is installed, the campaign request simply cannot be
 * made to qualify, and the caller is told so instead of being handed a
 * fabricated identity that the upstream will ignore.
 *
