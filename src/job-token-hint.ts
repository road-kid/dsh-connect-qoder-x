/**
 * The conversation hint row for a self-healed job token.
 *
 * The card's status notice proved hard to observe, so the visible channel is
 * the session itself. The harness records a command line as a pair of
 * **log-only** session events — `command/run` + `command/done`, the mechanism
 * behind the `[icon] new · 已开启新会话。` row (and the same icon a pwsh tool
 * row uses). Appending that pair directly prints one line into the
 * conversation: no turn is opened, no model round trip happens, and **nothing
 * is registered** — so no synthetic command ever appears in the `/` menu:
 *
 *     [icon] qoder · jobToken 已自动刷新（旧令牌被上游拒绝，已自动重换并恢复）
 *
 * and its failure mirror, printed when the heal ran and still lost:
 *
 *     [icon] qoder · jobToken 已重换但仍被上游拒绝（自愈未恢复，该请求已失败）
 *
 * The mirror used to point the reader at "the error above", which assumed the
 * failed heal belonged to a chat rendering a card in this conversation. A heal
 * inside the session-title request shares the transport and the notice state
 * but renders no card, so the pointer led nowhere. It now states only the
 * facts. Attribution stays best effort (`lastRunningAgent`): with two agents
 * running concurrently the row can land in the other one's conversation, which
 * is a display imprecision, never a wrong heal.
 *
 * The host half alone produces these rows; without a client renderer the title
 * is the recorded name, which is why it is the ASCII `qoder`.
 *
 * @module dsh-connect-qoder-x/job-token-hint
