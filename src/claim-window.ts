 * Qoder's daily claim window, as a date string.

 * just before 10:00 the following morning, so a window is NOT a calendar day:
 * the hours between midnight and 10:00 belong to the window that opened the
 * previous day. Anything that asks "is the current window already claimed?"
 * must compare window days, or it declares a live claim dead at midnight and
 * re-arms an action the upstream can only refuse.
 *
 * This lives on its own so both the scheduler and the transport can share one
 * definition without importing each other.
