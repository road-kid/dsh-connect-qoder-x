# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Entries describe
user-visible behaviour; commit messages carry the mechanism.

## 0.3.0

### Fixed — international (`qoder-global`) daily check-in never offered a claim

The international service only serves the daily 100-Credit campaign to requests that
carry a device risk identity minted by the Qoder **desktop client** on this machine.
The plugin sent a self-generated random UUID in its place (and no `Cosy-MachineCode`
at all), so the service answered HTTP 200 with a campaign list that never contained
the daily benefit — which surfaced as "no campaign today" and an unusable *Claim now*
button. The plugin now drives the installed client's signed `runtime-info` component
to obtain the real identity and sends it on both the campaign and the claim request.

- Requires the Qoder desktop client installed locally. When it is missing, the card
  says so plainly (`每日签到需要本机安装 Qoder 桌面客户端` / "needs the Qoder desktop
  app") instead of blaming the account. The China variant never required this
  identity and is unaffected.
- This was never a regression: the check-in path has no region-specific branch in any
  version, so the international claim did not work on older builds either.

### Fixed — check-in re-offered a claim after midnight, before 10:00

The claim window runs **10:00 → 10:00 the next day (UTC+8)**, not midnight →
midnight. Every "is this already claimed?" test compared calendar dates, so a benefit
claimed at 23:11 looked unclaimed at 00:44: the button went back to *Claim now* and a
scheduled sweep would have spent a second request the service can only refuse. All
three sites — the scheduler's settle test, the record's stored label, and the card's
`today` stamp — now compare the claim window, using each variant's own configured
window opening so they cannot drift apart.

### Fixed — ledger showed phantom claims with wrong timestamps

"最近领取 / Recent claims" recorded a `+100` row for **every** write, including repeat
clicks and scheduled runs that only learned the day was already claimed. Those rows
carry the observation clock rather than a grant instant, so the ledger filled with
entries the account never received, all stamped with the same back-computed expiry.
Now only a genuine grant mints a ledger row; an already-claimed day keeps the original
settlement untouched. A claim already granted by the service also keeps the button
disabled, so the repeat click that produced the noise is no longer invited.

### Fixed — a rejected PAT and an unreachable service reported the same error

`validateApiKey` answered a bare boolean, so "Qoder refused this token" and "we never
got an answer" were indistinguishable, and the card rendered both as *That PAT was
rejected* — sending users to regenerate a credential that had never been judged
whenever the endpoint was slow, offline, or returning 5xx. The two are now separate
outcomes with their own messages, in the card, the settings route and
`dsh-connect-qoder-x pat set`.

### Fixed — model-list refresh failures were silent

The route answers a failed refresh with **HTTP 200** and puts the reason in the
response body. The card checked only `response.ok`, so every failure looked like a
success: no message, and the stale model list stayed on screen. The card now reads the
body and shows the reason, and does not repaint over it.

### Changed — price factor `x0` now reads `x0.0`

Whole-number multipliers are padded to one decimal (`x0.0`, `x1.0`, `x2.0`) so a free
model reads as a rate beside its fractional neighbours, and the column keeps a steady
width. Fractional factors keep Qoder's own value (`x0.79` stays `x0.79`) — they are
real quoted rates, not rounded ones. Catalog rows stored before this change pick up
the new spelling on the next model-list refresh.

### Changed — DSH 0.2.x compatibility

The peer and engine ranges capped at `<0.2.0`, which would have had DSH disable this
plugin's row the moment 0.2.0 shipped final (the running `0.2.0-rc.1` already passed,
because prereleases participate in range matching). The ranges are widened to
`>=0.1.7-rc.1 <0.3.0`. Verified, not assumed: diffing the DSH tags `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2`
→ `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.1` shows **zero changed source files** across every package this
plugin imports, and the 0.1.7 plugin-configuration seats it registers on are the same
seats 0.2.x reads. The code needed no change. `^0.2.0` was deliberately not used: it
rejects the current `0.2.0-rc.1` and would drop 0.1.7 support.

### Fixed — lockfile could not be installed from a clone

`package.json` required the 0.1.7 release candidates while `pnpm-lock.yaml` still
pinned `^0.1.5-rc.1`, so a frozen install — CI's default — failed with
`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` on 16 mismatched dependencies. Regenerated; the frozen
check passes from a clean directory.

### Added — check-in panel shows what is actually held

The old free-form log table is replaced by a *Recent claims* panel that answers the
question users actually ask — which credit packages do I hold and when does each
expire — listing each grant with its own expiry, plus an expiring-within-3-days
summary. Qoder's own expiry travels from the claim to the card; a grant the service
did not date falls back to the documented 30-day convention rather than a guessed
date. `清空日志 / Clear logs` stays within reach.

### Improved — card content and the DSH 0.1.7 tool-role port

- The card now names the coding plan the credits belong to, and never renders a
  placeholder subscriber name.
- Tool results are ported to DSH 0.1.7's first-class `tool` role
  (`toolCallId` / `isError`) instead of being smuggled inside a `user` message, which
  0.1.7 and 0.2.x no longer read.
- Model list, context-window slider and usage panels were reshaped; dead settings
  surfaces, the redundant card shell and orphaned styles were removed.
- The plugin page now shows the package name `dsh-connect-qoder-x` with a description
  covering PAT-based access, dual-region support, model toggles, context windows,
  quota and check-in; the card's own one-liner was rewritten to match.

### Notes for testers

- Install/update requires `pnpm install` (the lockfile changed); rebuild with
  `pnpm run build` — `lib/` is committed, so source changes are invisible until built.
- After updating, refresh the model list once to re-store catalog rows with the new
  price-factor spelling.
- Full suite: **462–463 passed / 6–7 failed** of 469, every run. The failures are
  long-standing baseline cases (`adapter` 1, `catalog-lifecycle` 1, `reasoning-merge`
  4–5 flaky 5-second timeouts). `test:qoder` (the node --test transport suite) is
  131/131 green.
- International check-in can only be verified on a machine with the Qoder desktop
  client installed.
